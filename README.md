# Coding-Assignment-Data-Bias

Project Aim: Analyzing the Perspective model on the basis of fairness and bias.

Hypothesis: The Perspective model is religiously biased, that is, it is unfair towards certain religions.

Method: Using the Perspective model to get toxicity scores on 20 sample statements (5 Islam-themed toxic comments, 5 Islam-themed non-toxic comment, 5 Buddhism-themed toxic comments, 5 Buddhism-themed non-toxic comments).

Analysis of the results: The results prove the hypothesis right, because the toxicity accuracy for Islam-themed comments is 20 percent more than that for Buddhist comments. Although, the accuracy for non-toxic comments of both religions is 100%, the accuracy for Islam-themed toxic comments is 40% more than that for Buddhist-themed toxic comments.

Potential explanation for the bias: In my opinion the overall higher population of Muslims than Buddhists and the higher prevalance of Islamophobic comments result in the machine learning model being biased.
